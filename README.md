Using realtime beat detection can only get you so far when doing sound interactive sequencing of events in visualizations.

This application allows you to create named tracks in sync with key events in music or video in order to trigger transitions, effects, cuts, etc.

The included example loads a banks.js file which contains a JSON object bank of sequencer tracks which are keyed to claps, bass drum, snares, and other elements 
of the included sound file.

These are the same sequency tracks that are used in our demo for the Mozilla Web-o-Wonder: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/nocomply/
